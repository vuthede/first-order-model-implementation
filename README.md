# first-order-model-implementation
Steps: 
 + Play around with dataset first
 + Play with each module in `module`
 + Write `loss.py` contains loss functions in paper
 + Write `train.py` to train

Training experiments:
+ Keypoints constrain important ?
+ Loss VGG important, and better than only template matching loss
+ Only first order motion is good enough?
